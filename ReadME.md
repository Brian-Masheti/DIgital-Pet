## Description
This project creates a virtual pet using Python's Object-Oriented Programming. The Pet class in pet.py represents a pet with a name, hunger, energy, and happiness levels. You can feed, play with, or let the pet sleep, and it can learn tricks like "sit" or "roll over." The main.py file tests all features by creating a pet named Buddy and showing how its status changes.

## Files
- **pet.py**: Defines the Pet class with methods to manage the pet.
- **main.py**: Tests the Pet class with a pet named Buddy.
- **output.png**: Screenshot of the program's output.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3.8 or higher is installed.
2. Save pet.py and main.py in a folder.
3. Open a terminal in that folder:
   - Windows: Press Win + R, type cmd, navigate with cd path/to/folder.
   - Mac: Open Terminal, navigate with cd path/to/folder.
4. Run the program: `python main.py`
5. Check the output in the terminal (matches output.png).
